# google-sheets-form-copier
Google Apps Script to copy calculations (as they are inserted, not entered)

v1 - This currently houses the apps script to add a menu item to manually call a refresh. It goes from 'Form responses 1' to "Information". It copies the fomula based on row 2 of the information sheet.

v1.1 - Source and Target sheets defined, and set by sidebar.

v1.2 - Adding setting for target row to copy, and input box for entering this in settings.

v1.3 - Forcing settings to be in place before refresh can be used (in progress).
