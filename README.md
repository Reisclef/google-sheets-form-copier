# google-sheets-form-copier
Google Apps Script to copy calculations (as they are inserted, not entered)

v1 - This currently houses the apps script to add a menu item to manually call a refresh. It goes from 'Form responses 1' to "Information". It copies the fomula based on row 2 of the information sheet.

Next version will be to define the source and target sheets.
